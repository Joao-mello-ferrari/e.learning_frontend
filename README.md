# Why build a online learning platform
In order to practice and stablish a solid connection with the next.js way of coding, i decided to develop a web application.
Still, education is such an amazing area, and creating online tools so people can study in a better way is always nice.

# How can i download and run the project?
With simples steps, it will be able to run everything locally.
<ul>

  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    After that, you can simply create a new folder and use '<strong>git clone https://github.com/Joao-mello-ferrari/e.learning_frontend.git</strong>', or evetually, download the zip folder with the code. I would really encourage you to use git, it is just better ðŸ˜Š
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, run <strong>yarn install</strong> or <strong>npm install</strong> to add all dependencies and <strong>yarn dev</strong> or <strong>npm dev</strong> to run the project
  </li>
</ul>
