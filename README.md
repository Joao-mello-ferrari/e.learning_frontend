# Why build a online learning platform
In order to practice and stablish a solid connection with the next.js way of coding, i decided to develop a web application.
Still, education is such an amazing area, and creating online tools so people can study in a better way is always nice.

# Why use nextJS
-Next is a performatic REACT framework, which helps a lot in the devolopment of futuristics apps.
-With functionalities such as SSR and SSG, the userÂ´s experience is preserved, as well as a very optimized platform is built.
-If thats not enough, next has a beutiful integration with external APIs, such as databases, billing and content systems. Thus, to develop with next its nothing but great.
